Should you want to produce pdf yourself just use context.
You will need two modules and many also need to adjust fonts
to your liking. The modules are vim and simplefonts. Once you
have both of then properly installed just run make.

Please edit Makefile as I am using pdftk to encrypt the pdf so
probably you may want to remove it.

The work on these books have been moved to http://libreprogramming.org/books/
